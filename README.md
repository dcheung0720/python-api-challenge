The output data such as the cities.csv and Figures are located in the "output_data" directory.
The code solutions are located in the "WeatherPy" directory named VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb

The hvplot interactive visualizations cannot be viewed on the web on Github. I have attached my step 1 and 5 results from VacationPy in the "output_data" directory and are named "VacationPy_step_1.png" and "VacationPy_step_5.png"
